# Shares for work
Creating a set of rules and software for the democratic development of projects. Collaborators involved in tasks would be given shares for their involvement that would decide their profit and wage of the vote. The number of possible shares for each task and decide if the work has been done would be specified by people already contributed. The project would be developed based on its constitution describing the rules of cooperation including the project's goals, requirements, teams, stages, and many other things to keep the initiative fair and secure it from scams (this constitution should be really hard to change). This system would be open-source: available for anyone to use on their own, independently from 2do.net (no requirement to use its servers nor to publish it there).
